# Horiseon Site Refactor

## Description

This project was a code refactor for our client, Horiseon. Horiseon was looking for updating of their HTML and CSS for readibility, accessibility, and ease of use. In addition, there were several parameters included that would lead to better search engine optimization (SEO). I built this project to help Horiseon optimize and modernize the code for their website. My work on this project taught me that just because something works does not mean it cannot be improved. In addition, I learned the value of adding comments and ordering my CSS to line up with the structure of my HTML.
